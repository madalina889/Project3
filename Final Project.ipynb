      "\n",
      "* **Serving:**  It's typically served with various accompaniments, including:\n",
      "    * **Lavash or pide bread:** Used to scoop up the kebab and its juices.\n",
      "    * **Bulgur pilavı (bulgur wheat):** A common side dish.\n",

      "    * **Ezme (spicy tomato paste):** A flavorful condiment.\n",
