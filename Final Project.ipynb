      "* **Layering:**  A key feature is the layering of ingredients – rice, meat/vegetables, and spices – in a pot, often with yogurt or other liquids.  This allows the flavors to meld during cooking.\n",
      "* **Cooking Method:**  Biryani can be cooked in a variety of ways, including dum cooking (slow cooking in a sealed pot), baking, or stovetop methods.  Dum cooking is considered the most traditional and often results in a more flavorful and moist biryani.\n",

      "* **Lucknowi Biryani:** Often features a delicate, subtle flavor profile.\n",
      "* **Kolkata Biryani:**  Characterized by its use of potatoes and a slightly sweeter taste.\n",
